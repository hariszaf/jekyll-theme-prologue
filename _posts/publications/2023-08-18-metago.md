Based on the established MGnify resource, we developed [metaGOflow](https://metagoflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
metaGOflow supports the fast inference of taxonomic profiles from GO-derived data based on ribosomal RNA genes and their functional annotation using the raw reads. Thanks to the Research Object Crate packaging, relevant metadata about the sample under study, and the details of the bioinformatics analysis it has been subjected to, are inherited to the data product while its modular implementation allows running the workflow partially. The analysis of 2 EMO BON samples and 1 Tara Oceans sample was performed as a use case.


metaGOflow is an efficient and robust workflow that scales to the needs of projects producing big metagenomic data such as EMO BON. It highlights how containerization technologies along with modern workflow languages and metadata package approaches can support the needs of researchers when dealing with ever-increasing volumes of biological data. Despite being initially oriented to address the needs of EMO BON, metaGOflow is a flexible and easy-to-use workflow that can be broadly used for one-sample-at-a-time analysis of shotgun metagenomics data.
