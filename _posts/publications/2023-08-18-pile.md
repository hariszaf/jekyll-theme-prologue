A multitude of metabarcoding data analysis tools and pipelines have also been developed. 
Often, several developed workflows are designed to process the same amplicon sequencing data, making it somewhat puzzling to choose one among the plethora of existing pipelines. However, each pipeline has its own specific philosophy, strengths and
limitations, which should be considered depending on the aims of any specific study,
as well as the bioinformatics expertise of the user. In this review, we outline the input
data requirements, supported operating systems and particular attributes of thirtytwo amplicon processing pipelines with the goal of helping users to select a pipeline
for their metabarcoding projects.
