After 3 years and a half I finally made it! :-)

It's trivial to say about the good and the bad times but this is extremely valid.

I will try to keep contact to all those that helped me throught this task and to remember 
what I should do and what I should not. 

You may have a look in my Phd-slides:

We have so many things to deal with, war, economical crisis, climate and the list goes on. 

Science by itself cannot deal with all of that; it can play a great part thought when focusing on the actual social needs. 

Let's give our best to that direction!
