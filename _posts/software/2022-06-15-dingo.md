`dingo` is a Python package that supports a variety of methods to sample from the flux space of metabolic models, based on state-of-the-art random walks and rounding methods.
It relies on high dimensional sampling with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fast optimization methods to analyze the possible states of a metabolic network. 
To perform MCMC sampling, `dingo` relies on the C++ library [`volesti`](https://github.com/GeomScale/volesti), which provides several algorithms for sampling convex polytopes. 
Among the different ways to sample, `dingo` also implements the Multiphase Monte Carlo Sampling algorithm (see post for relative publication).

Flux sampling provides insgith of strong statistical evidence. 
For example, pairwise fluxes correlated with one another in a positive or negative way, can be found.

`dingo` also supports Flux Balance Analysis and Flux Variability Analysis, two standard methods to analyze the flux space of a metabolic network,.


`dingo` is part of the [GeomScale](https://geomscale.github.io) that is over the last year has been an organization of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).
