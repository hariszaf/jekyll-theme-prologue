Joining the [Fluxomics training school of Elixir Metabolomics Community](https://www.eventora.com/en/Events/fluxomics-2021/WebApp/Live/home) has been probably the highlight of all online events during this COVID-19 period. 

Beyond learning the basics of the various methods used when studying fluxes, I was so glad that I was proved wrong about online events and whether the attendees can actually interact one another. 

A big, big "thank you" to all members of the organizing committee and a promise for an in-person meeting sometime soon! ðŸ¦  ðŸ§¬
