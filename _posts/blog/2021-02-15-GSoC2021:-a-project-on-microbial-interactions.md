In the framework of [Google Summer of Code 2021](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) the [GeomScale group](https://geomscale.github.io/) has proposed, among others, a bio project! 

We will use `volesti` to sample on the flux space of metabolic networks and investigate potential microbial interactions. 

For more inforamtion, you may check the project [here](https://github.com/GeomScale/gsoc2021/wiki/Inferring-microbial-interactions).
