Really glad to start my [EMBO Scientific Exchange Grant](https://www.embo.org/funding/fellowships-grants-and-career-support/scientific-exchange-grants/) in the [Lab of Microbial Systems Biology](http://msysbiology.com/) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) and the [Rega Institute](https://rega.kuleuven.be/). 


Co-occurrence networks have been widely used for inferring microbial associations or/and interactions from metagenomic data. 
However, spurious associations and tool-dependence confine the network inference.
To address this challenge, we are about to develop ***microbetag***, an annotator tool to enhance co-occurrence network analysis for metagenomics data from microbial communities.

To follow our work, you may follow the [*microbetag* GitHub repo](https://github.com/hariszaf/microbetag).

Many thanks to [Prof. Karoline Faust](http://msysbiology.com/cv.html) for this opportunity and the incredible feedback! 


Let's see what we can do in 3-months! :wink:
