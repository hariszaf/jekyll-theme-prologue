Just found out about the great paper of Aleksej Zelezniak et al.
**"Metabolic dependencies drive species co-occurrence in diverse microbial communities"**.

As they authors claim "interspecies metabolic exchanges are widespread in natural communities, and such exchanges can provide
group advantage under nutrient-poor conditions.""

Their results *"highlight metabolic dependencies as a major driver of species co-occurrence"*.

You may find this [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/04/29/1421834112).
