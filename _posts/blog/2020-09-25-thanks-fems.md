Few months ago, thanks to a [FEMS Meeting Attendance Grant (MAG)](https://fems-microbiology.org/about_fems/network-and-activities/grants/) I was able to participate a Physalia course on [Metagenomics, Metatranscriptomics and Multi-omics for microbial community studies](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course33/).

[Here](https://mailchi.mp/fems-microbiology/fems-alumni-bulletin-august-2636818?e=d113f7fa09&fbclid=IwAR0-TBwWTmpeE9lpJkpeYkxK7zqgThLwNFlXKY3Y1AJNxewGVbf5Vof0mJQ) you can find the FEMS alumni bulletin of September 2020 and a thanks FEMS for this chance.

Thanks the @hutlab for all the great software and knowledge shared!
