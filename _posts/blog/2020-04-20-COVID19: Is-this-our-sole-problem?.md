"We must not lose sight of the persisting climate and ecological crisis when working out how to spur the economy after the coronavirus pandemic."
It is [13 ministers ](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/04/09/european-green-deal-must-central-resilient-recovery-covid-19/)  that say so.

* Question 1: *What is the reason for such a comment by those funding research to a great extent?*

It is exactly the way that research is funded with the antagonistic projects to rule over it, that has made this essential, worldwide issue to be an "opportunity" for many researchers and groups.
That is why groups whose field could not actually aid on the coronavirus treatment submit proposal to do so. Of course, many researchers have an honest agony to help. But would we observe
what is happening today if we had another way of funding in the research field?

* Question 2: *Does this comment of those ministers, should focus just in the attempt to 'spur the economy after the coronavirus pandemic' ?*

It would be hard for anyone to say so. In fact, the way the economy works the last 200 years played a huge part for both the evolution of viruses and how prepared
the states were and the way they address it. Thus, we should take into account the climate and ecological crisis but also the global economical crisis that is still here,
to figure out another way for organizing our communities.
