Last month, I  had the chance to visit ETH and the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Health. 

I was lucky to see the awsome bioreactors they have set over the years there in the Laboratory of Food Biotechnology 
but most importantly, a group of people that struggle to keep doing what they love. 

I was able to see how the data are produced but also spread the world about [microbetag](https://hariszaf.github.io/microbetag/), our co-occurrence network annotator.

For sure, two weeks were not enough, so I hope we will meet again even somewhere not as beautiful as the snowy Zurich. 
A great thanks to Dr. Annelies Geirnaert and Professor for this opportunity and to all the lab members for
making my stay so pleasant.
Of course, a special thanks to Dr. Andi Erega for all the explanations and patience with me knowing but the basics in the lab but mostly for the burek! 

See you soon I hope! :)
