Our software tool on investigating COI amplicon data  just got published on [MBMG journal](https://mbmg.pensoft.net/article/69657/). We hope that `darn` will benefit researchers as a quality control tool for their sequenced samples in terms of distinguishing eukaryotic from non-eukaryotic OTUs/ASVs, but also in terms of understanding the known unknowns. 


You may find it on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hariszaf/darn).
