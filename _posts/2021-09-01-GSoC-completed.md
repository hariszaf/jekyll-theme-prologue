My Google Summer of Code project has been completed! 

You may find [here](https://hariszaf.github.io/gsoc2021/) what [@GeomScale](https://twitter.com/GeomScale) and I 
did over the last 10 weeks! 

You can also find our project among the [GSoC 2021 projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4835597543276544).

We are still in the start, but [GSoC](https://twitter.com/gsoc) many thanks for supporting our 
efforts for random sampling over the flux space of microbial communities metabolic networks!
