Our world, as we know it, is in a constant crisis.

Two are the most pressing problems of our time; the relationships among the different classes of our modern community
and the relationships between our community and the nature.
Comprehending ecosystems' ecology can help us address a wide range of issues in a viriety of aspects, both scientific and societal.<br /><br />

That is the reason why I chose to focus my research curiosity on elucidating ecosystem function.<br /><br />

In 2016, I completed my BSc in Biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
It was then when I realised the great part that Bioinformatics play in every aspect of modern biology; in ecosystem functioning as well. <br /><br />

Then, I joined the Bioinformatics MSc program in the University of Crete (2016-2018).
During my master thesis, I became a member of <a href="http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/"> lab42open </a> at <a href="http://imbbc3.hcmr.gr/">IMBBC-HCMR</a>.
Since then, I have developed <a href="https://github.com/hariszaf/pema"><i>PEMA</i></a>,
a pipeline for the analysis of metabarcoding data.
PEMA has been selected from <a href="https://www.lifewatch.eu/">LifeWatch - ERIC</a> for the analysis of the ARMS derived data. <br /><br />

In the framework of the <a href="http://prego.hcmr.gr/">PREGO project</a>, I am  now conducting my PhD on microbial community ecology and ecosystem functioning . <br/>
I intend to merge analyses of different types of NGS data, knowledge aggregation and data  integration, along with network analysis,  to end up with some prommising hypotheses
regarding <b>how</b> ecosystems work and <b>what</b> is what we could do to restore the balance.
<br /><br/>


In 2020, I started to contribute to the <a href="https://geomscale.github.io/">GeomScale research and development project</a>
in the development of scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions and more specifically in the <a href="https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/"><i>volesti</i></a> project.
Later on, the <a href="https://github.com/geomScale/dingo"><i>dingo</i></a> library was initiated based on <i>volesti</i> to enable flux sampling in metabolic networks of high dimensions. 

My research interests focus on microbial ecology and ecosystem functioning at the microbial dimension; as each and every ecosystem type is based on the
microbes hosted. Hence, bioinformatics is nothing but a means to an end ? Actually, you could say so. But it is quite similar for the way to lead you to places you have never thought in the first place. Is it not? <br/><br/>

In this website you may find my so-far research work as well as some issues that have caught my attention.
