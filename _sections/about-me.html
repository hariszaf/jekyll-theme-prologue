Our world, as we know it, is in a constant crisis.

Two are the most pressing problems of our time; the relationships among the different classes of our modern community
and the relationships between our community and the nature.
Comprehending ecosystems' ecology can help us address a wide range of issues in a viriety of aspects, both scientific and societal.
And this is why I chose to focus my research curiosity on elucidating ecosystem function.<br /><br />

In 2016, I completed my BSc in Biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. <br />
<!-- It was then when I realised the great part that Bioinformatics play in every aspect of modern biology; in ecosystem functioning as well. <br /><br /> -->

After that, I joined the Bioinformatics MSc program in the University of Crete (2016-2018).
During my master thesis, I became a member of <a href="http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/"> lab42open </a> at <a href="http://imbbc3.hcmr.gr/">IMBBC-HCMR</a>.
<!-- Since then, I have developed <a href="https://github.com/hariszaf/pema"><i>PEMA</i></a>,
a pipeline for the analysis of metabarcoding data.
PEMA has been selected from <a href="https://www.lifewatch.eu/">LifeWatch - ERIC</a> for the analysis of the ARMS derived data. <br /><br /> -->

In the framework of the <a href="http://prego.hcmr.gr/">PREGO project</a>, 
I conducted my PhD on microbial community ecology through the lens of NGS technologies, data integration and metabolic networks. <br/>
<!-- I intend to merge analyses of different types of NGS data, knowledge aggregation and data  integration, along with network analysis,  to end up with some prommising hypotheses
regarding <b>how</b> ecosystems work and <b>what</b> is what we could do to restore the balance. -->
<br />

In 2020, I also started to contribute to the <a href="https://geomscale.github.io/">GeomScale</a> research and development project bringing together 
computational geometry with metabolic modelling. 
<!-- </a> -->
<!-- in the development of scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions. -->
<!-- and more specifically in the <a href="https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/"><i>volesti</i></a> project. -->
<!-- Later on, the <a href="https://github.com/geomScale/dingo"><i>dingo</i></a> library was initiated based on <i>volesti</i> to enable flux sampling in metabolic networks of high dimensions.  <br/><br/> -->

After defending my PhD in 2022, I joined <a href="msysbiology.com/">lab of microbial systems biology</a> 
at the <a href="https://rega.kuleuven.be">Rega institute</a> at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven">KU Leuven</a> 
and the <a href="https://www.3domics.eu">3D' omics</a> project. 

My research interests focus on microbial ecology and evolution.
<!-- as each and every ecosystem type is based on the microbes hosted.  -->
Hence, bioinformatics is nothing but a means to an end? 
One might say so. 
But it is quite similar for the way to lead you to places you have never thought in the first place. Is it not? <br/>

<!-- In this website you may find my so-far research work as well as some issues that have caught my attention. -->
