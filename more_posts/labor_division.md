From [Graika et al.](10.1016/j.cub.2020.08.007) (2020)
The division of labor displayed in anaerobic metabolic cascades appears to be hard-wired in the biology of the participating microorganisms: 
for example, no known microbe can degrade complex biopolymers anaerobically and at the same time perform methanogenesis [39].
