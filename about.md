## Hello friend


Our world, as we know it, is in a constant crisis.

Two are the most pressing problems of our time; the relationships among the different classes of our modern community
and the relationships between our community and the nature.
Comprehending ecosystems' ecology can help us address a wide range of issues in a viriety of aspects, both scientific and societal.
And this is why I chose to focus my research curiosity on elucidating ecosystem function.

In 2016, I completed my BSc in Biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
<!-- It was then when I realised the great part that Bioinformatics play in every aspect of modern biology; in ecosystem functioning as well. <br /><br /> -->

After that, I joined the Bioinformatics MSc program in the University of Crete (2016-2018).
During my master thesis, I became a member of 
[lab42open](http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/) at 
[IMBBC-HCMR](http://imbbc3.hcmr.gr/).
Since then, I have been working on [PEMA](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema),
a pipeline for the analysis of metabarcoding data.
<!-- PEMA has been selected from <a href="https://www.lifewatch.eu/">LifeWatch - ERIC</a> for the analysis of the ARMS derived data . <br /><br />  -->

After that, I conducted my PhD on microbial community ecology through the lens of NGS technologies, data integration and metabolic networks
in the framework of the [PREGO project](http://prego.hcmr.gr/).
<!-- I intend to merge analyses of different types of NGS data, knowledge aggregation and data  integration, along with network analysis,  to end up with some prommising hypotheses
regarding <b>how</b> ecosystems work and <b>what</b> is what we could do to restore the balance. -->

In 2020, I also started to contribute to the [GeomScale](https://geomscale.github.io/) research and development project bringing together 
computational geometry with metabolic modelling. 

<!-- </a> -->
<!-- in the development of scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions. -->
<!-- and more specifically in the <a href="https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation/"><i>volesti</i></a> project. -->
<!-- Later on, the <a href="https://github.com/geomScale/dingo"><i>dingo</i></a> library was initiated based on <i>volesti</i> to enable flux sampling in metabolic networks of high dimensions.  <br/><br/> -->




After defending my PhD in 2022, I joined 
[lab of microbial systems biology](msysbiology.com/) 
at the 
[Rega institute](https://rega.kuleuven.be) 
at 
[KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven) 
and the 
[3D' omics](https://www.3domics.eu) project. 


My research interests focus on microbial interactions, ecology and evolution.
<!-- as each and every ecosystem type is based on the microbes hosted.  -->
Hence, bioinformatics is nothing but a means to an end? 
One might say so. 
But it is quite similar for the way to lead you to places you have never thought in the first place. Is it not? <br/>

<!-- In this website you may find my so-far research work as well as some issues that have caught my attention. -->

Hi, I'm **DaeIn Lee**, *a.k.a.* **Lazy Ren**.<br>
I'm currently working at **[SAP Labs Korea]**, and previsouly was CSE student of **[Hanyang University]**.<br>
I like to solve brain teasing problems in field of CSE (probably the reason I liked multi-core programming / OS courses).<br>
And I'm also a [heavy gamer]!<br>
Pleaseh check my [resume] if you wish to know more about me.

## Work Hard to be Lazy

_My motto to live by._
{:.lead}

> “Working hard to be lazy basically means investing the extra effort (working hard) at first so that it will pay off in the long run (be lazy).”

## Re-evaluate your work processes

The lazy man will try to accomplish 2 hours worth of work in 1 hour’s time but sometimes at the expense of the work’s quality.<br>
Think of it as **efficiency = quality/time** taken (referencing speed = distance/over).<br>
If the time taken is reduced, either the job’s quality has to be lowered or the efficiency must be increased. Efficiency really relates to the work process.<br>
So in order to keep the quality the same and reduce the time taken, the work process must be changed.

## Don’t repeat yourself

After evaluating what you do, you may have some ideas of what you want to improve or modify.<br>
Break it down to its core.

## Try a new process

Be open to completely changing the way you work.<br>
You can’t expect to become more productive unless you pay a price at first.

## Refine yourself

By refining yourself I mean going through this work hard to be lazy process in iterations.<br>
Try a new process, if that doesn’t help as much as you hoped, try another process.<br>
The worst thing that could happen is that you don’t find any improvement in your work process and go back to your original process and just work hard.<br>
Did you lose anything?
