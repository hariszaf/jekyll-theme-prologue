## Hello friend


Our world, as we know it, is in a constant crisis.

Two are the most pressing problems of our time; the relationships among the different classes of our modern community
and the relationships between our community and the nature.
Comprehending ecosystems' ecology can help us address a wide range of issues in a viriety of aspects, both scientific and societal.
And this is why I chose to focus my research curiosity on elucidating ecosystem function.

In 2016, I completed my BSc in Biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
<!-- It was then when I realised the great part that Bioinformatics play in every aspect of modern biology; in ecosystem functioning as well. <br /><br /> -->

After that, I joined the Bioinformatics MSc program in the University of Crete (2016-2018).
During my master thesis, I became a member of 
[lab42open](http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/) at 
[IMBBC-HCMR](http://imbbc3.hcmr.gr/).
Since then, I have been working on [PEMA](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema),
a pipeline for the analysis of metabarcoding data.
<!-- PEMA has been selected from <a href="https://www.lifewatch.eu/">LifeWatch - ERIC</a> for the analysis of the ARMS derived data . <br /><br />  -->

After that, I conducted my PhD on microbial community ecology through the lens of NGS technologies, data integration and metabolic networks
in the framework of the [PREGO project](http://prego.hcmr.gr/).
<!-- I intend to merge analyses of different types of NGS data, knowledge aggregation and data  integration, along with network analysis,  to end up with some prommising hypotheses
regarding <b>how</b> ecosystems work and <b>what</b> is what we could do to restore the balance. -->

In 2020, I also started to contribute to the [GeomScale](https://geomscale.github.io/) research and development project bringing together 
computational geometry with metabolic modelling. 


After defending my PhD in 2022, I joined 
[lab of microbial systems biology](msysbiology.com/) 
at the 
[Rega institute](https://rega.kuleuven.be) 
at 
[KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven) 
and the 
[3D' omics](https://www.3domics.eu) project. 


My research interests focus on microbial interactions, ecology and evolution.
Hence, bioinformatics is nothing but a means to an end? 
One might say so. 
But it is quite similar for the way to lead you to places you have never thought in the first place. Is it not?
